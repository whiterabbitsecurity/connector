=head1 NAME

Connector - a generic connection to a hierarchical-structured data set

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Connector is generic connection to a data set, typically configuration
data in a hierarchical structure. Each connector object accepts the get(KEY)
method, which, when given a key, returns the associated value from the
connector's data source.

Typically, a connector acts as a proxy to a simple data source like
YAML, Config::Std, Config::Versioned, or to a more complex data source
like an LDAP server or Proc::SafeExec. The standard calling convention
via get(KEY) makes the connectors interchangeable.

In addition, a set of meta-connectors may be used to combine multiple
connectors into more complex chains. The Connector::Multi, for example,
allows for redirection to delegate connectors via symbolic links. If
you have a list of connectors and want to use them in a load-balancing,
round-robin fashion or have the list iterated until a value is found,
use Connector::List and choose the algorithm to perform.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Connector::MODULENAME;

    my $conn = Connector::MODULENAME->new( {
        LOCATION => $path_to_config_for_module,
    });

    my $val = $conn->get('full.name.of.key');

=head2 Connector Class

This is the base class for all Connector implementations. It provides
common helper methods and performs common sanity checking.

Usually this class should not be instantiated directly.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 die_on_undef

Set to true if you want the connector to die when a query reaches a non-exisiting 
node. This will affect only calls to get/get_list/get_hash and will not affect
values that are explicitly set to undef (if supported by the connector!). 

=head 1 Accessor Methods

Each accessor method is valid only special types of nodes. If you call them 
on a wrong type of node, the connector dies.

=head2 get

Basic method to obtain a scalar value at the leaf of the config tree.

  my $value = $connector->get('smartcard.owners.tokenid.bob');
  
Each implementation SHOULD also accept an arrayref as path. The path is 
contructed by joining the elements.

  my $value = $connector->get( [ 'smartcard.owners.tokenid', 'bob' ] );
  
Some implementations accept control parameters, which can be passed by
I<params>, which is a hash ref of key => value pairs.
  
  my $value = $connector->get( [ 'smartcard.owners.tokenid', 'bob' ], { version => 1 } );
 
=head2 get_list

This method is only valid if it is called on a "n-1" depth node representing 
an ordered list of items (array). The return value is an array with all 
values present below the node.
  
  my @items = $connector->get( [ 'smartcard.owners.tokenid', 'bob' ] );
 

=head2 get_size

This method is only valid if it is called on a "n-1" depth node representing 
an ordered list of items (array). The return value is the number of elements
in this array (including undef elements if they are explicitly given).
  
  my $count = $connector->get( 'smartcard.owners.tokens.bob' );
  
If the node does not exist, 0 is returned.
 
=head2 get_hash

This method is only valid if it is called on a "n-1" depth node representing 
a key => value list (hash). The return value is a hash ref. 
  
  my %data = %{$connector->get( [ 'smartcard.owners.tokens', 'bob' ] )};
 
 
=head2 get_keys

This method is only valid if it is called on a "n-1" depth node representing 
a key => value list (hash). The return value is an array holding the
values of all keys (including undef elements if they are explicitly given).
  
  my @keys = $connector->get( [ 'smartcard.owners.tokens', 'bob' ] );

If the node does not exist, an empty list is returned.

=head2 set

The set method is a "all in one" implementation, that is used for either type
of value. If the value is not a scalar, it must be passed by reference.

  $connector->set('smartcard.owners.tokenid.bob', $value, $params);

If the implementation supports the array ref notation for get, it must provide
it for set, too.

The I<value> parameter holds a scalar or ref to an array/hash with the data to 
be written. I<params> is a hash ref which holds additional parameters for the 
operation and can be undef if not needed.

=head1 STRUCTURAL METHODS
 
=head2 get_meta

This method returns some structural information about the current node as  
hash ref. At minimum it must return the type of node at the current path.

Valid values are I<scalar, list, hash, reference>. Reference is a scalar
reference which is used e.g. in Connector::Multi. The others correspond 
to the accessor methods given above.    

    my $meta = $connector->get_meta( 'smartcard.owners' );
    my $type = $meta->{TYPE};  

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

If the node does not exist, undef is returned. C<get_meta> will B<NOT> die
even if C<die_on_undef> is set, therefore you can use it to probe for a node. 

=head2 path building

You should alwayd pass the first parameter to the private C<_build_path> 
method. This method converts any valid path spec representation to a valid
path. In scalar context, you get a single string joined with the configured 
delimiter. In list context, you get an array with one path item per array 
element.  

=head2 Supported methods

The methods get, get_list, get_size, get_hash, get_keys, set, meta are routed 
to the appropriate connector.
