=head1 NAME

Connector::Builtin::Authentication::LDAP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Connector (see perldoc I<Connector>) to authenticate users against LDAP.
Supports simple authentication (via LDAP bind), SASL authentication is not
supported.

The module allows for direct bind or indirect bind (with preliminary user
search). Direct bind is the most straightforward method, but it requires
users to know their Distinguished Names (DNs) in LDAP. Indirect bind is more
convenient for users, but it involves LDAP database search, which requires read
access to larger parts of LDAP directory (so LDAP ACLs must be set properly to
allow indirect bind).

The module implements group participation checking. With this option enabled,
only users that belong to a predefined group may pass the authentication.
The group is stored in LDAP directory (it may be for example an entry of
type I<groupOfUniqueNames> with the group participants listed in attribute
I<uniqueMember>).

When requesting indirect bind, the internal user search may return multiple
DNs. By default this is treated as an error (because of ambiguity) and results
with authentication failure. This may be changed by setting a parameter named
I<ambiguous>, in which case the module will try to consecutively bind to each
DN from the search result.

The indirect bind may be configured to use custom search filter, instead of
the default one. This allows to incorporate additional restrictions on users
based on their attributes stored in LDAP.

=head2 Usage

The username is the first component of the path, the password needs to be
passed in the extended parameters using the key password.

Example:

   $connector->get('username', {  password => 'mySecret' } );

To configure module for direct bind, the connector object should be created
with parameter I<indirect> => 0. This is the simplest authentication method
and requires least parameters to be configured.

Example:

    my $connector = Connector::Builtin::Authentication::LDAP->new({
        LOCATION => 'ldap://ldap.example.org',
        indirect => 0
    })
    my $result = $connector->get(
        'uid=jsmith,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org',
        { password => 'secret' }
    );


Indirect bind, which is default, searches through the LDAP directory. This
usually requires read access to database, and is performed by a separate user.
We'll call that user I<binddn>. For indirect-bind authentication, one usually
has to provide DN and password of the existing I<binddn> user.

Example:

    my $connector = Connector::Builtin::Authentication::LDAP->new({
        LOCATION => 'ldap://ldap.example.org',
        binddn => 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org',
        password => 'binddnPassword'
    })
    my $result = $connector->get('jsmith', { password => 'secret' });

Two parameters are used to check group participation: I<groupdn> and
I<groupattr>. The I<groupdn> parameter specifies DN of a group entry and the
I<groupattr> specifies an attribute of the I<groupdn> object where group
participants are listed. If you specify I<groupdn>, the group participation
check is enabled.


Example:

    # Assume, we have in LDAP:
    #
    # dn: cn=vip,dc=example,dc=org
    # objectClass: groupOfNames
    # member: uid=jsmith,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
    #
    my $connector = Connector::Builtin::Authentication::LDAP->new({
        LOCATION => 'ldap://ldap.example.org',
        indirect => 0,
        binddn => 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org',
        password => 'binddnPassword',
        groupdn => 'cn=vip,dc=example,dc=org',
    })
    my $result = $connector->get(
        'uid=jsmith,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org',
        { password => 'secret' }
    );

Note, that in this case we have provided I<binddn> despite the direct-bind
authentication was used. This is, because we needed read access to the
C<cn=vip,dc=example,dc=org> entry (the group object).

The indirect-bind method accepts custom filters for user search.

Example:

    my $connector = Connector::Builtin::Authentication::LDAP->new({
        LOCATION => 'ldap://ldap.example.org',
        binddn => 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org',
        password => 'binddnPassword',
        filter => '(&(uid=[% LOGIN %])(accountStatus=active))'
    })
    my $result = $connector->get('jsmith', { password => 'secret' });

You may substitute user name by using I<[% LOGIN %]> template parameter,
as shown in the above example.

=head2 Configuration

Below is the full list of configuration options.

=head3 Connection options

See Connector::Proxy::Net::LDAP

=head3 SSL Connection options

=over 8

=item B<verify> => 'none' | 'optional' | 'require'

How to verify the server's certificate:

    none
        The server may provide a certificate but it will not be checked - this
        may mean you are be connected to the wrong server
    optional
        Verify only when the server offers a certificate
    require
        The server must provide a certificate, and it must be valid.

If you set B<verify> to optional or I<require>, you must also set either
B<cafile> or B<capath>. The most secure option is require.

=item B<sslversion>  => 'sslv2' | 'sslv3' | 'sslv23' | 'tlsv1'

This defines the version of the SSL/TLS protocol to use. Defaults to 'tlsv1'.

=item B<ciphers> => CIPHERS

Specify which subset of cipher suites are permissible for this connection,
using the standard OpenSSL string format. The default behavior is to keep the
decision on the underlying cryptographic library.

=item B<capath> => '/path/to/servercerts/'

See B<cafile>.

=item B<cafile> => '/path/to/servercert.pem'

When verifying the server's certificate, either set B<capath> to the pathname
of the directory containing CA certificates, or set B<cafile> to the filename
containing the certificate of the CA who signed the server's certificate. These
certificates must all be in PEM format.


=item B<clientcert> => '/path/to/cert.pem'

See B<clientkey>.

=item B<clientkey> => '/path/to/key.pem'

If you want to use the client to offer a certificate to the server for SSL
authentication (which is not the same as for the LDAP Bind operation) then set
B<clientcert> to the user's certificate file, and B<clientkey> to the user's
private key file. These files must be in PEM format.

=item B<checkcrl> => 1

=back

=head3 BindDN

=over 8

=item B<binddn> => DN

Distinguished Name of the LDAP entry used to search LDAP database for users
being authenticated (indirect bind) and check their group participation.

=item B<password> => PASSWORD

Password for the B<binddn> user.

=back

=head3 Search options (indirect bind)

=over 8

=item B<timelimit> => N

A timelimit that restricts the maximum time (in seconds) allowed for a search.
A value of 0 (the default), means that no timelimit will be requested.

=item B<sizelimit> => N

A sizelimit that restricts the maximum number of entries to be returned as a
result of the search. A value of 0, and the default, means that no restriction
is requested. Servers may enforce a maximum number of entries to return.

=item B<base> => DN

The DN that is the base object entry relative to which the search is to be
performed.

=item B<filter> => TEMPLATESTRING

A filter that defines the conditions an entry in the directory must meet in
order for it to be returned by the search. This may be a (template) string or a
Net::LDAP::Filter object.

=item B<scope>  => 'base' | 'one' | 'sub' | 'subtree' | 'children'

By default the search is performed on the whole tree below the specified base
object. This maybe changed by specifying a scope parameter with one of the
following values:

    base
        Search only the base object.
    one
        Search the entries immediately below the base object.
    sub
    subtree
        Search the whole tree below (and including) the base object. This is
        the default.
    children
        Search the whole subtree below the base object, excluding the base object itself.

Note: children scope requires LDAPv3 subordinate feature extension.

=back

=head3 Other options

=over 8

=item B<userattr> => ATTRNAME

If the search B<filter> (for indirect bind) is not specified, it is constructed
internally as I<"($userattr=[% LOGIN %])">, where I<$userattr> represents the
value of B<userattr> parameter.

=item B<groupattr> => ATTRNAME

If B<groupdn> is specified by caller, the B<groupattr> defines an attribute
within B<groupdn> object which shall be compared against the DN of the user
being authenticated in order to check its participation to the group. Defaults
to I<'member'>.

=item B<groupdn> => DN

DN of an LDAP entry which defines a group of users allowed to be authenticated.
If not defined, the group participation is not checked.

=item B<indirect> => 1 | 0

Use indirect bind (default). Set to I<0> to disable indirect bind and use
direct bind.

=item B<ambiguous> => 0 | 1

Accept ambiguous search results when doing indirect-bind authentication. By
default, this option is disabled.

=back

=head2 Return values

Returns the DN of the matched entry, 0 if the user is found but the
password does not match and undef if the user is not found (or it's found
but group check failed).

=head2 Limitations

User names are limited to so called I<valueencoding> syntax defined by RFC4515.
We allow non-ascii (utf-8) characters and non-printable characters. Invalid
names are treated as not found.
